# portfolio vanilla
Note: these files were in another repo but i had a limited internet connection so this is the finished project.

Building a what could be **my future personal portfolio website**. The reason it's public is for recruiters and other interested learners to view the code.
This is a vanilla version using pure HTML and CSS.
In the final version, i plan to use frameworks like tailwind, react, next, and maybe add some 3d spice to it tooðŸ¤Œ</br>

You'll see that i've used some transitions and transforms on cards and buttons (was a challenging task for me as my CSS skills are not there yet)

**ionic icons** used for icons on this project instead of bootstrap icons or font awesome.</br>
**Google fonts** used to fetch fonts instead of including them locally </br>

The project is large compared to the actual content because of git history which i don't want to delete. You'll see it all as is. The good, bad and everything in between.
